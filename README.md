# ‚ù§ Moe Script API
This is a fluent script api for writing performant, low overhead, MapleStory scripts.
We do this by constructing proxy objects that communicate between the api and the script files.
The API itself is heavily modelled after nexon's own api, with some minor additions here and there, like text command scripts.

### Examples
For a more in depth explanation, see [**the wiki**](https://github.com/y785/script-api/wiki/Basic-Script-Examples). 
All scripts extend their base script type, so a script for an Npc would extend the NpcScript, etc.
Additionally, all logic is conducted in the ``Script::work()`` method. You shouldn't have to extend any underlying logic methods to have functioning scripts, for a more detailed explanation or outlook on scripts, see [my main script repo](https://github.com/y785/moe-scripts).
